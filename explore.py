#                 CLUSTERING: EXPLORATION EXERCISES
# =============================================================================
# =============================================================================
# Exercises I - Required
# =============================================================================



# =============================================================================
# 
# Our Telco scenario continues:
# 
# As a customer analyst for Telco, you want to know who has spent the most money with
#  the company over their lifetime. You have monthly charges and tenure, so you think you
#  will be able to use those two attributes as features to estimate total charges.
#  You need to do this within an average of $5.00 per customer.
# 
# In these exercises, you will run through the stages of exploration as you continue
#  to work toward the above goal.
# 
# Do your work in a notebook named explore.ipynb. In addition, you should create
# a file named explore.py that contains the following functions for exploring your
#  variables (features & target).
# =============================================================================



# =============================================================================
# 1.) Make sure to perform a train, validate, test split before and use only
#  your train dataset to explore the relationships between independent variables
#  with other independent variables or independent variables with your target
#  variable.
# =============================================================================




# =============================================================================
# 2.) Write a function named plot_variable_pairs that accepts a dataframe
#     as input and plots all of the pairwise relationships along with the regression
#     line for each pair.
# ====





# =============================================================================
# 3.) Write a function named months_to_years that accepts your telco churn
#     dataframe and returns a dataframe with a new feature tenure_years, in 
#     complete years as a customer.
# =============================================================================





# =============================================================================
# 4.) Write a function named plot_categorical_and_continuous_vars that accepts
#     \your dataframe and the name of the columns that hold the continuous and
#     categorical features and outputs 3 different plots for visualizing a
#     categorical variable and a continuous variable.
# =============================================================================




# =============================================================================
# 5.) Save the functions you have written to create visualizations in your
#     
#    explore.py file. Rewrite your notebook code so that you are using the
#    functions imported from this file
# =============================================================================





# =============================================================================
# 6.) Explore your dataset with any other visualizations you think will be helpful.
# =============================================================================






# =============================================================================
# 7.) In a seperate notebook, use the functions you have developed in this exercise
#     with the mall_customers dataset in the Codeup database server. You will need
#     to write a sql query to acquire your data. Make spending_score your target variable.
# =============================================================================










# =============================================================================
#                     Exercises II - Challenge
# =============================================================================


# =============================================================================
# Our Zillow scenario continues:
# 
# As a Codeup data science graduate, you want to show off your skills to
#  the Zillow data science team in hopes of getting an interview for a position
#  you saw pop up on LinkedIn. You thought it might look impressive to build an
#  end-to-end project in which you use some of their Kaggle data to predict
#  property values using some of their available features; who knows, you might
#  even do some feature engineering to blow them away. Your goal is to predict
#  the values of single unit properties using the observations from 2017.
# 
# In these exercises, you will run through the stages of exploration as you
#  continue to work toward the above goal.
# =============================================================================




# =============================================================================
# 1.) Use the functions you created above to explore your Zillow train
#     dataset in your explore.ipynb notebooK
# =============================================================================






# =============================================================================
# 2.) Come up with some initial hypotheses based on your goal of predicting
#     property value.
# =============================================================================




# =============================================================================
# 3.)Visualize all combinations of variables in some way.
# =============================================================================





# =============================================================================
# 4.)Run the appropriate statistical tests where needed.
# =============================================================================



# =============================================================================
# 5.) What independent variables are correlated with the dependent variable, home value?
# =============================================================================



# =============================================================================
# 6.) Which independent variables are correlated with other independent
#     variables (bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, square feet)?
# =============================================================================





# =============================================================================
# 7.) Make sure to document your takeaways from visualizations and statistical
#     tests as well as the decisions you make throughout your procesS.
